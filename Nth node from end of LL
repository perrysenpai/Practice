int getNthFromLast(Node h, int n)
    {
        Node head=h;
        int count=0;
    	while(head!=null)
    	{
    	    count++;
    	    head=head.next;
    	}
    	if(n>count)
    	return -1;
    	int diff=count-n+1;
        count=0;
    	while(diff-->1)
    	{
    	    h=h.next;
    	}
        
        return h.data;
    }
    

APPROACH 2
    
void printNthFromLast(struct Node* head, int n) 
{ 
    static int i = 0; 
    if (head == NULL) 
        return; 
    printNthFromLast(head->next, n); 
    if (++i == n) 
        printf("%d", head->data); 
} 


APPROACH 3:
Method 2 (Use two pointers)
Maintain two pointers â€“ reference pointer and main pointer. Initialize both reference and main pointers to head.
First, move reference pointer to n nodes from head. Now move both pointers one by one until the reference pointer reaches the end.
Now the main pointer will point to nth node from the end. Return the main pointer.
